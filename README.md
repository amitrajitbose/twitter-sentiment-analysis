# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
###### "Because I'm Too Lazy to check Twitter .."
------------------------------------------------
Hi There!
This is a simple notebook to analyse the current top trends on Twitter along with their sentiment distributions. 

For example : How many people are thinking positively or negative about a topic. I have also made a very easy to use module for checking the sentiment distribution and analyse the opinions using pie chart which is available as `visualise()`

_Please note that I have intentionally erased the API and access tokens for obvious security issues. You need to generate your own token from apps.twitter.com._
